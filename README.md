**Sea Moster Crowdfunding** is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

*  The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

*  The filter <ins>buttons change color</ins> when the mouse hovers over or clicks them so the user knows which filter they are applying.
